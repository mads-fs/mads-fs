# Nordic Game Jam submission 2024

The original name for this game was "Mirror/You" but since changed to "Shape of Them".
The theme this year was based on the MDA framework (Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics) and as such the themes were:
- Mechanics: Reflection
- Dynamics: Keeping a Secret
- Aesthetics: Sense of Belonging

Our submission was mainly based around "Reflection" but we felt there was an argument to be made for it also fitting "Sense of Belonging".
